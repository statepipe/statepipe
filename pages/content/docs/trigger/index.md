## Reducers for :pipe

All reducers at `$statepipeStores.trigger`

ðŸ‘‰  Read more about [:trigger here]({{<ref "/core/triggers" >}}).

> Most of the reducers used the same ones defined for [pipe()](../pipe). They allow you - most of the time - to work with only the state (ignoring the payload) so it works for :out and :trigger as well.
